hi all, I'd like to learn coding. I am a SW deployment manager (SAP finance modules) and I'd like to actually start using computers to create something on my own (besides making music in a punk-rock band). 

I have a huge collection of CDs, vinyls, DVDs, etc. which I'd like to eventually start reducing (in order to free up the space for the new stuff) so why not learning how to code by creating a dedicated personal commercial page ?!

Any advice and guidance will be most appreciated (you may even get our free merch when this project is successful!! :))
